# Cubestack_Bootloader
This binary code is used to flash the ATSAMD21G18 CPU in the Cubestack to act as an Arduino Zero when communicating with the Arduino IDE. 
Then, the Arduino IDE can load .ino Arduino code into memory.

See the "Using J-Link to Load Code onto Cubestack" file in the CPSS Drive in the Avionics section.
